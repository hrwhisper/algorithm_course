The Wolf and the Lamb 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him. He thus addressed him:"Sirrah, 
last year you grossly insulted me." "Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a
mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born." Then said the Wolf
, "You feed in my pasture." "No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I 
have not yet tasted grass." Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my
well." "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as 
yet my mother's milk is both food and drink to me." Upon which 
the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, "Well! I won't remain 
supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations." 
The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny. 
The Bat and the Weasels 
A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel 
pleaded to be spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he 
was by nature the enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he
was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly
afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by
another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him. The
Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice. The Bat assured
him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time 
escaped. 
It is wise to turn circumstances to good account. 
The Ass and the Grasshopper 
AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly
enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody,
demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such
beautiful voices. They replied, "The dew." The Ass resolved that
he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger. 
The Lion and the Mouse A LION was awakened from sleep by a 
Mouse running over his face. 
Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when
the Mouse piteously entreated, saying: "If you would only spare
my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness." The Lionlaughed
and let him go. It happened shortly after this that theLion was 
caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to the round.
The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came gnawed the rope with his 
teeth, and set him free, exclaim "You ridiculed the idea ofmy ever 
being able to help you,expecting to receive from me any repay 
ment of your favor; I nowyou know that it is possible for even a
Mouse to con benefits on a Lion."

The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller 
A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. 
One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and 
live with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and
that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened. The Fuller
replied, "The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned,
for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again
with your charcoal." 
Like will draw like. 
The Father and His Sons 
A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling
among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his
exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration
of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose he one day told
them to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he
placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession,
and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their 
strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the faggot, 
took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his
sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then ddressed
them in these words: "My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite 
to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the 
attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves
, you will be broken as easily as these sticks." 
The Boy Hunting Locusts 
A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number,
when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached
out his hand to take him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said:
If you had but touched me, my friend, you would have lost me, 
and all your locusts too!" 
The Cock and the Jewel 
A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a
precious stone and exclaimed: "If your owner had found thee, and
not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first 
estate; but I have found thee for no purpose. I would rather have 
one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world."

The Kingdom of the Lion 
THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He
was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a 
king could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a 
general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up onditions
for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther
and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should
live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, "Oh, how I
have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place
with impunity by the side of the strong." And after the Hare said 
this, he ran for his life. 
The Wolf and the Crane 
A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a
large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. 
When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the romised
payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed:
"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in
having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the
mouth and jaws of a wolf." 
In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you
escape injury for your pains. 
The Fisherman Piping 
A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the
seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes
in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of
their own accord dance into his net, which he had placed below. 
At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and
casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. 
When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said:
"O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not 
dance,but now that I have ceased you do so merrily." 
Hercules and the Wagoner 
A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the
wheels sank down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied
and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter
loud cries to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, 
appeared and thus addressed him: "Put your shoulders to the 
wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to 
me for help, until you have done your best to help yourself, or
depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain." 
Self-help is the best help. 
The Ants and the Grasshopper 
THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain ollected
in the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed
by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of
him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?' He
replied, "I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing." 
They then said in derision: "If you were foolish enough to sing all 
the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter."

The Traveler and His Dog 
A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at
the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: "Why do you 
stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me
instantly." The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master! I am
quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting." 
The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend. 
The Dog and the Shadow 
A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in
his mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that
of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He
immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other
Dog to get his larger piece from him. He thus lost both: that
which he grasped at in the water, because it was a shadow; and
his own, because the stream swept it away. 
The Mole and His Mother 
A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: "I
am sure than I can see, Mother!" In the desire to prove to him
his mistake, his Mother placed before him a few grains of
frankincense, and asked, "What is it?' The young Mole said, "It
is a pebble." His Mother exclaimed: "My son, I am afraid that you
are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell. 
The Herdsman and the Lost Bull 
A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from
the fold. After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that,
if he could only discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he
would offer a lamb in sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian
Deities of the forest. Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small 
hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion feeding on the Calf. 
Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, 
and said: "Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian 
Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me; 
but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a 
full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own
escape from him in safety." 
The Hare and the Tortoise 
A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing: "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race." The Hare, believing her assertion to
be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed 
that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal. On the day
appointed for the race the two started together. The Tortoise never
for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace 
straight to the end of the course. 
The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last
waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her
fatigue. 
Slow but steady wins the race.

The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble 
THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was
the most beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble 
from the neighboring hedge lifted up its voice, and said in a 
boastful tone: "Pray, my dear friends, in my presence at least cease
from such vain disputings." 
The Farmer and the Stork 
A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught
a number of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he
trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was 
earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. "Pray save
me, Master," he said, "and let me go free this once. My broken
limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork,
a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my 
father and mother. Look too, at my feathers-- they are not the least
like those of a Crane." The Farmer laughed aloud and said, "It may
be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these 
robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company." 
Birds of a feather flock together. 
The Farmer and the Snake 
ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold.
He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. 
The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its
natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal
wound. "Oh," cried the Farmer with his last breath, "I am rightly 
served for pitying a scoundrel." 
The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful. 
The Fawn and His Mother 
A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, "You are larger than a
dog, and swifter, and more used to running, and you have your 
horns as a defense; why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten
you so?"
She smiled, and said: "I know full well, my son, that all you say
is true. I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even
the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as
fast as I can." 
No arguments will give courage to the coward.
Page6
The Bear and the Fox 
A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all
animals he was the most tender in his regard for man, for he had
such respect for him that he would not even touch his dead body. 
A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, "Oh!
that you would eat the dead and not the living." 
The Swallow and the Crow 
THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their 
plumage. 
The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying, "Your feathers are
all very well in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter." 
Fair weather friends are not worth much. 
The Mountain in Labor 
A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises
were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to see what
was the matter. While they were assembled in anxious expectation
of some terrible calamity, out came a Mouse. 
Don't make much ado about nothing. 
The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion 
THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for
their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They
had not proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing
imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive 
for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word 
not to harm the Fox. Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would 
not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he
should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured,
immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure.

The Tortoise and the Eagle 
A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the
sea-birds of her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. 
An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what
reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float
her in the air. "I will give you," she said, "all the riches of the Red 
Sea." "I will teach you to fly then," said the Eagle; and taking her 
up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let 
her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain, dashing her shell to pieces
. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: "I have deserved
my present fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who 
can with difficulty move about on the earth?' 
If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined. 
The Flies and the Honey-Pot 
A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had 
been overturned in a housekeeper's room, and placing their feet in
it, ate greedily. Their feet, however, became so smeared with the
honey that they could not use their wings, nor release themselves, 
and were suffocated. Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, 
"O foolish creatures that we are, for the sake of a little pleasure we
have destroyed ourselves." 
Pleasure bought with pains, hurts. 
The Man and the Lion 
A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon
began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in
strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a
statue carved in stone, which represented "a Lion strangled by a
Man." The traveler pointed to it and said: "See there! How strong
we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts." The
Lion replied: "This statue was made by one of you men. If we
Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed
under the paw of the Lion." 
One story is good, till another is told. 
The Farmer and the Cranes 
SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands
newly sown with wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an
empty sling, chased them away by the terror he inspired; but when
the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air, they 
ceased to take any notice of it and would not move. The Farmer,
on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great
number. The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying
to each other, "It is time for us to be off to Liliput: for this man is 
no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest 
what he can do." 
If words suffice not, blows must follow. 
Page8
The Dog in the Manger 
A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping 
prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for 
them. 
"What a selfish Dog!" said one of them to his companions; "he
cannot eat the hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat
who can." 
The Fox and the Goat 
A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of
escape. A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and
seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good. Concealing his
sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise 
of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and 
encouraging him to descend. The Goat, mindful only of his
thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox
informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a
scheme for their common escape. "If," said he, "you will place
your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up
your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards." The Goat
readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying
himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the
well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided
him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out,
"You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head
as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down
before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself 
to dangers from which you had no means of escape." 
Look before you leap. 
The Bear and the Two Travelers 
TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met 
them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and
concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must 
be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up 
and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his 
breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. 
The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body.
When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the 
tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had 
whispered in his ear. "He gave me this advice," his companion 
replied. "Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the 
approach of danger." 
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends. 
The Oxen and the Axle-Trees 
A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a
team of Oxen. The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; 
whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: 
"Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear all the 
labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out." 
Those who suffer most cry out the least. 
Page9
The Thirsty Pigeon 
A PIGEON, oppressed by excessive thirst, saw a goblet of water
painted on a signboard. Not supposing it to be only a picture,
she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed
against the signboard, jarring herself terribly. Having broken
her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and was caught by
one of the bystanders. 
Zeal should not outrun discretion. 
The Raven and the Swan 
A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same
beautiful plumage. Supposing that the Swan's splendid white
color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam, the
Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his
living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools. But
cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change
their color, while through want of food he perished. 
Change of habit cannot alter Nature. 
The Goat and the Goatherd 
A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. 
He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no
attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone,
and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. 
The Goat replied, "Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak
though I be silent." 
Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid. 
The Miser 
A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he
buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and
went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent
visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon
discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down,
came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next
visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to
make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with
grief and learning the cause, said, "Pray do not grieve so; but
go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the
gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same
service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did
not make the slightest use of it."
Page10
The Sick Lion 
A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself
with food by force, resolved to do so by artifice. He returned
to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking
care that his sickness should be publicly known. The beasts
expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the
Lion devoured them. After many of the beasts had thus
disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself
to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a respectful
distance, and asked him how he was. "I am very middling,"
replied the Lion, "but why do you stand without? Pray enter
within to talk with me." "No, thank you," said the Fox. "I
notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but
I see no trace of any returning." 
He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others. 
The Horse and Groom 
A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and 
rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and 
sold them for his own profit. "Alas!" said the Horse, "if you really 
wish me to be in good condition, you should groom me less, and
feed me more." 
The Ass and the Lapdog 
A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese Lapdog, a very great beauty. 
The Ass was left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat,
just as any other Ass would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and 
was a great favorite with his master, who often fondled him and
seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to
eat. The Ass, on the contrary, had much work to do in grinding
the corn-mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens
from the farm. He often lamented his own hard fate and
contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at
last one day he broke his cords and halter, and galloped into his
master's house, kicking up his heels without measure, and
frisking and fawning as well as he could. He next tried to jump
about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the
table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms. He then
attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back. The
servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of
their master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his
stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Ass, as he returned
to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: "I have
brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to
labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day
like that useless little Lapdog!" 
The Lioness 
A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to 
which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the
greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously
into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the
settlement of the dispute. "And you," they said, "how many sons
have you at a birth?' The Lioness laughed at them, and said:
"Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred
Lion." 
The value is in the worth, not in the number. 
The Boasting Traveler 
A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on
returning to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic
feats he had performed in the different places he had visited. 
Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had
leaped to such a distance that no man of his day could leap
anywhere near him as to that, there were in Rhodes many persons 
who saw him do it and whom he could call as witnesses. One of 
the bystanders interrupted him, saying: "Now, my good man, if 
this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this 
to be Rhodes, and leap for us." 
Page11
The Cat and the Cock 
A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a 
reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a 
nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not permitting 
them to sleep. 
The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the
benefit of men, that they might rise in time for their labors. 
The Cat replied, "Although you abound in specious apologies, I
shall not remain supperless"; and he made a meal of him. 
The Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat 
A YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a 
Sheep. 
On one occasion when the shepherd laid hold of him, he grunted
and squeaked and resisted violently. The Sheep and the Goat
complained of his distressing cries, saying, "He often handles
us, and we do not cry out." To this the Pig replied, "Your
handling and mine are very different things. He catches you only
for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very
life." 
The Boy and the Filberts 
A BOY put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts. He grasped
as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out
his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the
pitcher. Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to
withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his
disappointment. A bystander said to him, "Be satisfied with half
the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand." 
Do not attempt too much at once. 
The Lion in Love 
A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage. The
Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request,
hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities. He
expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his
daughter on one condition: that he should allow him to extract
his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully
afraid of both. The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. 
But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his
request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his
club, and drove him away into the forest.
Page12
The Laborer and the Snake 
A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage,
inflicted a mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son. Grieving over 
his loss, the Father resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, when
it came out of its hole for food, he took up his axe, but by 
swinging too hastily, missed its head and cut off only the end of its
tail. After some time the Cottager, afraid that the Snake would bite
him also, endeavored to make peace, and placed some bread and 
salt in the hole. The Snake, slightly hissing, said: "There can 
henceforth be no peace between us; for whenever I see you I 
shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you 
will be thinking of the death of your son." 
No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused
the injury. 
The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 
ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his appearance
in order to secure food more easily. Encased in the skin of a
sheep, he pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd by his
costume. In the evening he was shut up by the shepherd in the
fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly
secure. But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf
instead of a sheep, and killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find. 
The Ass and the Mule 
A MULETEER set forth on a journey, driving before him an Ass 
and a Mule, both well laden. The Ass, as long as he traveled along
the plain, carried his load with ease, but when he began to ascend 
the steep path of the mountain, felt his load to be more than he 
could bear. He entreated his companion to relieve him of a small 
portion, that he might carry home the rest; but the Mule paid no 
attention to the request. The Ass shortly afterwards fell down dead
under his burden. Not knowing what else to do in so wild a region,
the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in 
addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the 
Ass, after he had skinned him. The Mule, groaning beneath his 
heavy burden, said to himself: "I am treated according to my 
deserts. If I had only been willing to assist the Ass a little in his 
need, I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, 
himself as well." 
The Frogs Asking for a King 
THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent
ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King. Perceiving their
simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake. The Frogs were 
terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in 
the depths of the pool. But as soon as they realized that the huge 
log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, 
dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in 
contempt. After some time they began to think themselves ill-
treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second 
deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another 
sovereign. He then gave them an Eel to govern them. When the 
Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to
Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King. Jupiter, 
displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed 
upon the Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon 
the lake. 
Page13
The Boys and the Frogs 
SOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the
water and began to pelt them with stones. They killed several of
them, when one of the Frogs, lifting his head out of the water,
cried out: "Pray stop, my boys: what is sport to you, is death to
us." 
The Sick Stag 
A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. 
His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health,
and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been
placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but
from the failure of the means of living. 
Evil companions bring more hurt than profit. 
The Salt Merchant and His Ass 
A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt. His road
home lay across a stream into which his Ass, making a false step,
fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably
lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his
steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than 
before. When he came again to the stream, the Ass fell down
on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the
weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he
had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick
and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a
cargo of sponges instead of salt. The Ass, again playing the
fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the
sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. 
And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his
back a double burden. 
The Oxen and the Butchers 
THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, 
who practiced a trade destructive to their race. They assembled on
a certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns
for the contest. But one of them who was exceedingly old (for
many a field had he plowed) thus spoke: "These Butchers, it is
true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with
no unnecessary pain. If we get rid of them, we shall fall into the 
hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double death: for 
you may be assured, that though all the Butchers should perish, yet
will men never want beef." 
Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.

The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox 
A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep
in his den. A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him 
from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, 
and searched every corner of his den to find the Mouse. A Fox 
seeing him said: "A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a ouse."
"'Tis not the Mouse I fear," said the Lion; "I resent his familiarity 
and ill-breeding." 
Little liberties are great offenses. 
The Vain Jackdaw 
JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to create a sovereign over the
birds, and made proclamation that on a certain day they should
all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose
the most beautiful among them to be king. The Jackdaw, knowing
his own ugliness, searched through the woods and fields, and
collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his
companions, and stuck them in all parts of his body, hoping
thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all. When the
appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before
Jupiter, the Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many
feathered finery. But when Jupiter proposed to make him king
because of the beauty of his plumage, the birds indignantly
protested, and each plucked from him his own feathers, leaving
the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw. 
The Goatherd and the Wild Goats 
A GOATHERD, driving his flock from their pasture at eventide,
found some Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up
together with his own for the night. The next day it snowed very
hard, so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding
places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold. He gave his
own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive, but fed the
strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay
with him and of making them his own. When the thaw set in, he
led them all out to feed, and the Wild Goats scampered away as
fast as they could to the mountains. The Goatherd scolded them
for their ingratitude in leaving him, when during the storm he
had taken more care of them than of his own herd. One of them,
turning about, said to him: "That is the very reason why we are
so cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the
Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that if others came
after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves."
Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones. 
The Mischievous Dog 
A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and
to bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about
his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence
wherever he went. Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog
grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the
marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: Why do you make
such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not,
believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of
disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill
mannered dog." 
Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
Page15
The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail 
A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail. 
Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule
to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other
Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making
up for his own deprivation. He assembled a good many Foxes and
publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would 
not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid
of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience. 
One of them interrupting him said, "If you had not yourself lost 
your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us." 
The Boy and the Nettles 
A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother,
saying, "Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently."
"That was just why it stung you," said his Mother. "The next time 
you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to 
your hand, and not in the least hurt you." 
Whatever you do, do with all your might. 
The Man and His Two Sweethearts 
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun to turn gray, courted two women at the same time. One of them was young, and
the other well advanced in years. The elder woman, ashamed to be
courted by a man younger than herself, made a point, whenever her
admirer visited her, to pull out some portion of his black hairs. The
younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an
old man, was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she
could find. Thus it came to pass that between them both he very
soon found that he had not a hair left on his head. 
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody. 
The Astronomer 
AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars.
One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole
attention fixed on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well. 
While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried 
loudly for help, a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had 
happened said: "Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into 
what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on earth?'
Page16
The Wolves and the Sheep 
"WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between 
us?" said the Wolves to the Sheep. "Those evil-disposed Dogs 
have much to answer for. They always bark whenever we pproach
you and attack us before we have done any harm. If you would 
only dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties of
peace and reconciliation between us." The Sheep, poor silly 
creatures, were easily beguiled and dismissed the Dogs, whereupon
the Wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure. 
The Old Woman and the Physician 
AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a
Physician to heal them, and made this bargain with him in the
presence of witnesses: that if he should cure her blindness, he
should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity
remained, she should give him nothing. This agreement being
made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to her
eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her
property little by little. And when he had got all she had, he
healed her and demanded the promised payment. The Old Woman,
when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her
house, would give him nothing. The Physician insisted on his
claim, and. as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge. 
The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued: "This man here
speaks the truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a
sum of money if I should recover my sight: but if I continued
blind, I was to give him nothing. Now he declares that I am healed.
I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use
of my eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods
: but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not
able to see a single thing in it." 
The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle 
TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the
farmyard. One at last put the other to flight. The vanquished
Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the
conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed
exultingly with all his might. An Eagle sailing through the air
pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons. The
vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled
henceforth with undisputed mastery. 
Pride goes before destruction. 
The Charger and the Miller 
A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a
mill instead of going out to battle. But when he was compelled
to grind instead of serving in the wars, he bewailed his change
of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, "Ah!
Miller, I had indeed to go campaigning before, but I was barbed
from counter to tail, and a man went along to groom me; and now I
cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the
battle." "Forbear," said the Miller to him, "harping on what was
of yore, for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups
and downs of fortune." 
Page17
The Fox and the Monkey 
A MONKEY once danced in an assembly of the Beasts, and so 
pleased them all by his performance that they elected him their 
King. A Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat 
lying in a trap, and leading the Monkey to the place where it was, 
said that she had found a store, but had not used it, she had kept it
for him as treasure trove of his kingdom, and counseled him to lay
hold of it. The Monkey approached carelessly and was caught in 
the trap; and on his accusing the Fox of purposely leading him into
the snare, she replied, "O Monkey, and are you, with such a mind
as yours, going to be King over the Beasts?"
The Horse and His Rider 
A HORSE SOLDIER took the utmost pains with his charger. As
long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in 
all emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn. But when
the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him
carry heavy loads of wood, subjecting him to much slavish
drudgery and ill-treatment. War was again proclaimed, however,
and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard, the Soldier
put on his charger its military trappings, and mounted, being
clad in his heavy coat of mail. The Horse fell down straightway
under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his
master, "You must now go to the war on foot, for you have
transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you 
expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?' 
The Belly and the Members 
THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said,
"Why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your
wants, while you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy
yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?' The Members carried out
their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly. The whole 
Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and 
eyes, when too late, repented of their folly. 
The Vine and the Goat 
A VINE was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes.
A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves. The 
Vine addressed him and said: "Why do you thus injure me without
a cause, and crop my leaves? Is there no young grass left? But I 
shall not have to wait long for my just revenge; for if you now 
should crop my leaves, and cut me down to my root, I shall rovide
the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the 
sacrifice." 
Page18
Jupiter and the Monkey 
JUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest 
and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be
deemed the handsomest. The Monkey came with the rest and
presented, with all a mother's tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-
featured young Monkey as a candidate for the promised reward. A
general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son. She 
resolutely said, "I know not whether Jupiter will allot the prize to 
my son, but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes of me his 
mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all." 
The Widow and Her Little Maidens 
A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to 
wait on her. She was in the habit of waking them early in the
morning, at cockcrow. The maidens, aggravated by such excessive
labor, resolved to kill the cock who roused their mistress so
early. When they had done this, they found that they had only
prepared for themselves greater troubles, for their mistress, no
longer hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up to their work
in the middle of the night. 
The Shepherd's Boy and the Wolf 
A SHEPHERD-BOY, who watched a flock of sheep near a village,
brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out,
"Wolf! Wolf!" and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed
at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. 
The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of
terror: "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the
sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any
assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure
lacerated or destroyed the whole flock. 
There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth. 
The Cat and the Birds 
A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing
dressed himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag
of instruments becoming his profession, went to call on them. He
knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did,
saying that if they were ill, he would be happy to prescribe for
them and cure them. They replied, "We are all very well, and
shall continue so, if you will only be good enough to go away,
and leave us as we are." 
Page19
The Kid and the Wolf 
A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a
Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. 
The Wolf, looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not
thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing." 
Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the
strong. 
The Ox and the Frog 
AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and
crushed one of them to death. The Mother coming up, and missing
one of her sons, inquired of his brothers what had become of him. 
"He is dead, dear Mother; for just now a very huge beast with
four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with
his cloven heel." The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, "if
the beast was as big as that in size." "Cease, Mother, to puff
yourself out," said her son, "and do not be angry; for you would,
I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness
of that monster." 
The Shepherd and the Wolf 
A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up,
and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring
flocks. The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the
Shepherd, "Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a
sharp lookout, or you will lose some of your own flock." 
The Father and His Two Daughters 
A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the
other to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who
had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all
things went with her. She said, "All things are prospering with
me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of
rain, in order that the plants may be well watered." Not long
after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and
likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for
nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may
continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks
might be dried." He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain,
and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my
wishes?' 
Page20
The Farmer and His Sons 
A FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his
sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had
given it. He called them to his bedside and said, "My sons,there is 
a great treasure hid in one of my vineyards." The sons,after his 
death, took their spades and mattocks and carefully dug over every
portion of their land. They found no treasure, but the vines repaid
their labor by an extraordinary and superabundant crop. 
The Crab and Its Mother 
A CRAB said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my 
child?
It is far more becoming to go straight forward." The young Crab
replied: "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the
straight way, I will promise to walk in it." The Mother tried in
vain, and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her
child. 
Example is more powerful than precept. 
The Heifer and the Ox 
A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and
tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being
compelled to labor. Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival,
the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer
with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of
the occasion. The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a
smile to the Heifer: "For this you were allowed to live in
idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed." 
The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice 
A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of 
dwelling with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of 
Justice and there hatched seven young birds. A Serpent gliding 
past the nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged
nestlings. The Swallow, finding her nest empty, lamented greatly
and exclaimed: "Woe to me a stranger! that in this place where
all others' rights are protected, I alone should suffer wrong." 
Page21
The Thief and His Mother 
A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and 
took it home to his Mother. She not only abstained from beating 
him, but encouraged him. He next time stole a cloak and brought it
to her, and she again commended him. The Youth, advanced to
adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value. At
last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound
behind him, was led away to the place of public execution. His
Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in
sorrow, whereupon the young man said, "I wish to say something
to my Mother in her ear." She came close to him, and he quickly
seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The Mother
upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, "Ah! if
you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that
lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus
led to a disgraceful death." 
The Old Man and Death 
AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and,
in carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very
wearied with his long journey. He sat down by the wayside, and
throwing down his load, besought "Death" to come. "Death"
immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for 
what reason he had called him. The Old Man hurriedly replied, 
"That, lifting up the load, you may place it again upon my 
houlders." 
The Fir-Tree and the Bramble 
A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, "You are useful for
nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses."
The Bramble answered: 'You poor creature, if you would only call
to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you
would have reason to wish that you had grown up a Bramble, not a
Fir-Tree." 
Better poverty without care, than riches with. 
The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk 
A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance 
formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the 
most part in the water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, 
bound the foot of the Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined 
together, the Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the 
meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. After this,
he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until
reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the
Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam
croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy 
Mouse was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body 
floated about on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk
observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft. 
The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also
carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk. 
Harm hatch, harm catch. 
Page22
The Man Bitten by a Dog 
A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of 
someone who might heal him. A friend, meeting him and learning 
what he wanted, said, "If you would be cured, take a piece of 
bread, and dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and give it
to the Dog that bit you." The Man who had been bitten laughed at
this advice and said, "Why? If I should do so, it would be as if I
should beg every Dog in the town to bite me." 
Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of
injuring you. 
The Two Pots 
A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of
earthenware and the other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the
Brass Pot, "Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for
if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces,
and besides, I by no means wish to come near you." 
Equals make the best friends. 
The Wolf and the Sheep 
A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and 
maimed in his lair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who
was passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream 
flowing close beside him. "For," he said, "if you will bring me 
drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat." "Yes," said 
the Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless
make me provide the meat also." 
Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through. 
The Aethiop 
THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the 
color of his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of 
his former masters. On bringing him home he resorted to every 
means of cleaning, and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings.
The servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color 
or complexion. 
What's bred in the bone will stick to the flesh. 
Page23
The Fisherman and His Nets 
A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful 
cast and captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful
handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them to 
the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from falling
back through the meshes of the net into the sea. 
The Huntsman and the Fisherman 
A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by
chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well 
laden with fish. The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their 
owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-
bag. 
They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day's sport. 
Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some
time the same exchange day after day. Finally a neighbor said to
them, "If you go on in this way, you will soon destroy by frequent
use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will again wish to 
retain the fruits of his own sport." 
Abstain and enjoy. 
The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar 
AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full
of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its
former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose, 
and drawing it backwards and forwards said, "O most delicious! 
How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it leaves behind in 
the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfume!" 
The memory of a good deed lives. 
The Fox and the Crow 
A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it
in her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat
himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded. "How handsome is 
the Crow," he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the
fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to
her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of
Birds!" This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to refute
the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped
the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the
Crow: "My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is
wanting." 
Page24
The Two Dogs 
A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports,
and a Housedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned 
home after a good day's sport, he always gave the Housedog a 
large share of his spoil. The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this,
reproached his companion, saying, "It is very hard to have all
this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, luxuriate
on the fruits of my exertions." The Housedog replied, "Do not
blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not
taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of
others." 
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents. 
The Stag in the Ox-Stall 
A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the
danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid
himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly
warning: "O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your own
accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your
enemy?' The Stag replied: "Only allow me, friend, to stay where I
am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of
effecting my escape." At the approach of the evening the herdsman
came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the
farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and
failed to notice him. The Stag, congratulating himself on his
safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had
kindly helped him in the hour of need. One of them again
answered him: "We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not
over. There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has
as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your
life is still in peril." At that moment the master himself
entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been
properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out: "Why is
there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw
for them to lie on. Those lazy fellows have not even swept the
cobwebs away." While he thus examined everything in turn, he
spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the
straw. Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag
should be seized and killed. 
The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons 
THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon
the Hawk to defend them. He at once consented. When they had
admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc
and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could
pounce upon in a whole year. 
Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease. 
The Widow and the Sheep 
A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing 
time,wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared 
him herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece
she sheared the flesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, "Why
do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood add to 
the wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill
me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool, there is
the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me." 
The least outlay is not always the greatest gain. 
The Wild Ass and the Lion 
A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might
capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The Lion agreed
to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass gave 
the Lion the benefit of his greater speed. When they had taken as 
many beasts as their necessities required, the Lion undertook to 
distribute the prey, and for this purpose divided it into three shares.
"I will take the first share," he said, "because I am King: and the 
second share, as a partner with you in the chase: and the third 
share (believe me) will be a source of great evil to you, unless you 
willingly resign it to me, and set off as fast as you can." 
Might makes right.
Page25
The Eagle and the Arrow 
AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare
whom he sought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle
from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded 
him mortally. The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had ntered
his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had been 
furnished by himself. "It is a double grief to me," he exclaimed, 
"that I should perish by an arrow feathered from my own wings." 
The Sick Kite 
A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: "O Mother! do not
mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be 
prolonged." She replied, "Alas! my son, which of the gods do you
think will pity you? Is there one whom you have not outraged by
filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered up to 
them?' 
We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in
adversity. 
The Lion and the Dolphin 
A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out
of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance,
saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends,
since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other
was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The
Dolphin gladly consented to this request. Not long afterwards
the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin
to help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him
assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means
reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin
replied, "Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while
giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the
power of living upon the land." 
The Lion and the Boar 
ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general 
thirst among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same 
moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of 
them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a
mortal combat. When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath 
for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in
the distance to feast on the one that should fall first. They at
once made up their quarrel, saying, "It is better for us to make
friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures."
Page26
The One-Eyed Doe 
A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the
edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing
her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land
that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter
or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she
entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by
saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. 
Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: "O
wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the
land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come
for safety, so much more perilous." 
The Shepherd and the Sea 
A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw 
the Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a
view to commerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of
dates, and set sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the
ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise
overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship. 
Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the
unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, "It is
again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet." 
The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion 
AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion,
desperate from hunger, approached the spot. He was about to
spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice
the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and
the Lion fled away as fast as he could. The Ass, observing his
trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to
attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose. He had run
no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and
tore him to pieces. 
False confidence often leads into danger. 
The Mice and the Weasels 
THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each 
other,in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always 
the victors. The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent
defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general
army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers 
from lack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that
were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and
counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the
fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and
formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was
done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly
proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen
generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more
conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun,
when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as 
fast as they could to their holes. The generals, not being able to
get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all
captured and eaten by the Weasels. 
The more honor the more danger. 
The Mice in Council 
THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best 
devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great
enemy the Cat. Among the many plans suggested, the one that 
found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the 
Cat, so that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, 
might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach.
But when the Mice further debated who among them should thus 
"bell the Cat," there was no one found to do it. 
Page27
The Wolf and the Housedog 
A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar 
about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet
compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. 
"The master," he replied. Then said the Wolf: "May no friend of
mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is
enough to spoil the appetite." 
The Rivers and the Sea 
THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, 
"Why is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet,
you work in us such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?"
The Sea, perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him,
said, "Pray cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made
briny." 
The Playful Ass 
AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about
there, broke in the tiling. The owner went up after him and
quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden
cudgel. The Ass said, "Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing
yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded you
very great amusement." 
The Three Tradesmen 
A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called
together to consider the best means of protecting it from the
enemy. A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording
the best material for an effective resistance. A Carpenter, with
equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of
defense. Upon which a Currier stood up and said, "Sirs, I differ
from you altogether: there is no material for resistance equal to
a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather." 
Every man for himself. 
Page28
The Master and His Dogs 
A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first
of all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of
his household. The storm still continuing, he was obliged to
slaughter his yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took
counsel together, and said, "It is time for us to be off, for if
the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how can we
expect him to spare us?' 
He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family. 
The Wolf and the Shepherds 
A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a 
haunch of mutton for their dinner. Approaching them, he said, 
"What a clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are doing!" 
The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat THE DOLPHINS and 
Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at
its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he 
would reconcile their differences if they would accept him as an 
umpire. One of the Dolphins replied, "We would far rather be 
destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference 
from you in our affairs." 
The Ass Carrying the Image 
AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous 
wooden Image, to be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed 
along, the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image. The 
Ass, thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for
himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused
to move another step. The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his
whip lustily about his shoulders and said, "O you perverse
dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an
Ass." 
They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to others. 
The Two Travelers and the Axe 
TWO MEN were journeying together. One of them picked up an 
axe that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an axe." "Nay, 
my friend," replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found
an axe." They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the
axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said, "We 
are undone." "Nay," replied the other, "keep to your first mode of
speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right now. 
Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone." 
He who shares the danger ought to share the prize. 
Page29
The Old Lion 
A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on
the ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and
avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. 
Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he
were an enemy. When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be
assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his
heels. The expiring Lion said, "I have reluctantly brooked the
insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such
treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a
double death." 
The Old Hound 
A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never
yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a
boar in the chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could
not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that
the boar escaped. His master, quickly coming up, was very much
disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The Hound looked up
and said, "It was not my fault. master: my spirit was as good as
ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather deserve to
be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I
am." 
The Bee and Jupiter 
A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to
Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. 
Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give
whatever she should ask. She therefore besought him, saying,
"Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall approach
to take my honey, I may kill him." Jupiter was much displeased,
for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the request
because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee: "You shall
have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. 
For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make,
and then you will die from the loss of it." 
Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost. 
The Milk-Woman and Her Pail 
A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field
to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. "The money for which
this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. 
The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and
fifty chickens. The chickens will become ready for the market
when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of
the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new
gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where
all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head
and refuse them every one." At this moment she tossed her head in
unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the
ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.
Page30
The Seaside Travelers 
SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to 
the summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the
distance what they thought was a large ship. They waited in the
hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which
they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found
that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship. When
however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only a
large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions,
"We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to
see but a load of wood." 
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities. 
The Brazier and His Dog 
A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his
master, and his constant companion. While he hammered away at
his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to
dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as
if he would ask for a share of his meal. His master one day,
pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, "You
wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am
hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to
eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food. Do
you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that
none but those who work are entitled to eat?' 
The Ass and His Shadow 
A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The
day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the
Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under
the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one,
and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a
violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the
right to the Shadow. The owner maintained that he had let the
Ass only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had,
with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel
proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the 
Ass galloped off. 
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance. 
The Ass and His Masters 
AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food
and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from
his present service and provided with another master. Jupiter,
after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to
be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards, finding that he had
heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he
petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter, telling him
that it would be the last time that he could grant his request,
ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The Ass found that he had
fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation,
said, groaning: "It would have been better for me to have been
either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the
other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my
present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and
make me useful to him." 
Page31
The Oak and the Reeds 
A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown 
across a stream. It fell among some Reeds, which it thus 
addressed: "I wonder how you, who are so light and weak, are not
entirely crushed by these strong winds." They replied, "You fight 
and contend with the wind, and consequently you are destroyed; 
while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air, and
therefore remain unbroken, and escape." 
Stoop to conquer. 
The Fisherman and the Little Fish 
A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day 
caught a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor. The Fish,
panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life: "O Sir, what good 
can I be to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to
my full size. Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I 
shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then
you can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me." The
Fisherman replied, "I should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for
the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I were to forego my 
present certain gain." 
The Hunter and the Woodman 
A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. 
He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks 
of his footsteps or knew where his lair was. "I will," said the man,
"at once show you the Lion himself." The Hunter, turning very pale
and chattering with his teeth from fear,replied, "No, thank you. I 
did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion 
himself." 
The hero is brave in deeds as well as words. 
The Wild Boar and the Fox 
A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against 
the trunk. A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his
teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman
or hound. He replied, "I do it advisedly; for it would never do
to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time I ought to be
using them." 
Page32
The Lion in a Farmyard 
A LION entered a farmyard. The Farmer, wishing to catch him,
shut the gate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he
flew upon the sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. 
The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened
the gate and released the Lion. On his departure the Farmer
grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but
his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said,
"On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for a
moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your
farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only
hear his roar at a distance?' 
Mercury and the Sculptor 
MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he 
was held among mortals. For this purpose he assumed the haracter
of a man and visited in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having 
looked at various statues, he demanded the price of two figures of
Jupiter and Juno. When the sum at which they were valued was 
named, he pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor, 
"You will certainly want much more for this, as it is the statue of 
the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain." The
Sculptor replied, "Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling you that into
the bargain." 
The Swan and the Goose 
A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan. 
He fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its
song. When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to
get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to
distinguish one bird from the other. By mistake he caught the
Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan, threatened with death,
burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice,
and preserved his life by his melody. 
The Swollen Fox 
A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by 
shepherds in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a 
hearty meal. When he finished, he was so full that he was not able 
to get out, and began to groan and lament his fate. Another Fox
passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of
his complaining. On learning what had happened, he said to him,
"Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you become
such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get
out." 
Page33
The Fox and the Woodcutter 
A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter
felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. 
The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the
Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came
up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen
the Fox. He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed,
all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden. 
The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word, 
hastened forward in the chase. As soon as they were well away, the
Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter: 
whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, "You 
ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me 
without a word of thanks." The Fox replied, "Indeed, I should 
have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good
as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your
speech." 
The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock 
A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs 
when a friend unexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite 
empty, as he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied 
Partridge, which he had tamed for a decoy. The bird entreated 
earnestly for his life: "What would you do without me when next 
you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for 
you the covey of answering birds?' The Birdcatcher spared his life,
and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to his 
comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: 
"If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the 
dawn? 
Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time
to visit the bird-trap in the morning?' He replied, "What you say
is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But
my friend and I must have our dinners." 
Necessity knows no law. 
The Monkey and the Fishermen 
A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen 
casting their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their 
proceedings. 
The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to
dinner left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the
most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and
endeavored to do as they had done. Having handled the net, he
threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and
drowned. With his last breath he said to himself, "I am rightly
served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to
try and catch fish?' 
The Flea and the Wrestler 
A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him,
causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the
Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, "O
Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope
for your assistance against greater antagonists?'
Page34
The Two Frogs 
TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool. When the pool dried up 
under the summer's heat, they left it and set out together for 
another home. As they went along they chanced to pass a deep 
well, amply supplied with water, and when they saw it, one of the 
Frogs said to the other, "Let us descend and make our abode in 
this well: it will furnish us with shelter and food." The other replied
with greater caution, "But suppose the water should fail us. How 
can we get out again from so great a depth?' 
Do nothing without a regard to the consequences. 
The Cat and the Mice 
A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering 
this,made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by 
one. 
Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their
holes. The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived
that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose
she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended
to be dead. One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and
said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a
meal-bag, we will not come near you." 
The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox 
A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought
fiercely for its possession. When they had fearfully lacerated
each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down
exhausted with fatigue. A Fox, who had gone round them at a
distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground
with the Kid lying untouched in the middle. He ran in between
them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could. The
Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said,
"Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored 
ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox." 
It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another
all the profit. 
The Doe and the Lion 
A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging
to a Lion. The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach,
but when she was safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore
her to pieces. "Woe is me," exclaimed the Doe, "who have 
escaped from man, only to throw myself into the mouth of a wild 
beast?' 
In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into another.
Page35
The Farmer and the Fox 
A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his 
poultry yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an 
ample revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set
it on fire. The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields
of the Farmer who had captured him. It was the time of the wheat
harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and returned
home grieving sorely. 
The Seagull and the Kite 
A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep
gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and
exclaimed: "You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air
has no business to seek its food from the sea." 
Every man should be content to mind his own business. 
The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury 
A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a
vessel, of which the crew and passengers were all drowned. He 
inveighed against the injustice of Providence, which would for the 
sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many 
innocent persons to perish. As he was indulging in these 
reflections, he found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants,
near whose nest he was standing. One of them climbed up and 
stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his 
foot. Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with
his wand, said, "And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of 
the dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner
treated these poor Ants?' 
The Mouse and the Bull 
A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried 
to capture him. But the Mouse reached his hole in safety. Though
the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he
could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep
outside the hole. The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his
flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole. The Bull
rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. At
which the Mouse said, "The great do not always prevail. There
are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do
mischief."
Page36
The Lion and the Hare 
A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep. He was just in
the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he
left the Hare to follow him. The Hare, scared by the noise,
awoke and scudded away. The Lion was unable after a long chase
to catch the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare. On
finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, "I am rightly
served, for having let go of the food that I had in my hand for
the chance of obtaining more." 
The Peasant and the Eagle 
A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much dmiring
the bird, set him free. The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to
his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which
was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a
bundle from his head. When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the
Eagle let the bundle fall again. Taking it up, the man returned
to the same place, to find that the wall under which he had been
sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service
rendered him by the Eagle. 
The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter 
A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image
of Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and 
begged the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he
became poorer and poorer. At last, being very angry, he took his
image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. 
When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which
the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, "Well, I think thou art
altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you
honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am
loaded with an abundance of riches." 
The Bull and the Goat 
A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some 
shepherds had recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-
Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull
quietly addressed him: "Butt away as much as you will. I have no 
fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster go away and I will 
soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a
Bull." 
It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in 
distress.
Page37
The Dancing Monkeys 
A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally
great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt
pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they
danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often
repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier,
bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and
threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts
forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys
instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing their
robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing
spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of
the audience. 
The Fox and the Leopard 
THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful
of the two. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots
which decorated his skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said,
"And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated,
not in body, but in mind." 
The Monkeys and Their Mother 
THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The
Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection
and care, but hates and neglects the other. It happened once
that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered 
by the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one 
was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was
exposed. 
The best intentions will not always ensure success. 
The Oaks and Jupiter 
THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, "We bear for
no purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we
are the most continually in peril of the axe." Jupiter made answer: 
"You have only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to
which you are exposed: for if you did not make such excellent
pillars and posts, and prove yourselves so serviceable to the
carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not so frequently be
laid to your roots." 
Page38
The Hare and the Hound 
A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave
up the chase. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying
"The little one is the best runner of the two." The Hound
replied, "You do not see the difference between us: I was only
running for a dinner, but he for his life." 
The Traveler and Fortune 
A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome 
with fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about
to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him
and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him: "Good Sir,
pray wake up: for if you fall into the well, the blame will be
thrown on me, and I shall get an ill name among mortals; for I
find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however
much by their own folly they have really brought them on
themselves." 
Everyone is more or less master of his own fate. 
The Bald Knight 
A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden 
puff of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang
forth from his companions. He pulled up his horse, and with
great glee joined in the joke by saying, "What a marvel it is
that hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have
forsaken even the man on whose head they grew." 
The Shepherd and the Dog 
A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was 
about to shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the 
wolf said, "Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you
admit a wolf into the fold?' 
The Lamp 
A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted
that it gave more light than the sun. Then a sudden puff of wind
arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished. Its owner lit
it again, and said: "Boast no more, but henceforth be content to
give thy light in silence. Know that not even the stars need to
be relit" 
Page39
The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass 
THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to 
assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the 
Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due
portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass
carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly
requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion,
bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he
requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The
Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and
left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said,
"Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division?
You are perfect to a fraction." He replied, "I learned it from the 
Ass, by witnessing his fate." 
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others. 
The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter A BULL finding a
lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns. The Lioness 
came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. A wild-boar
Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to her, 
"Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the 
loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you." 
The Oak and the Woodcutters 
THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in 
pieces,making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. 
The Oak said with a sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe
aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by
these wedges made from my own branches." 
Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear. 
The Hen and the Golden Eggs 
A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg 
every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump
of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. 
Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen
differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair,
thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of
the gain of which they were assured day by day. 
Page40
The Ass and the Frogs 
AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he
was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and
fell, and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned
heavily. Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation,
and said, "What would you do if you had to live here always as we
do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water?"
Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do
large misfortunes. 
The Crow and the Raven 
A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a 
bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who
noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events. Seeing
some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and
perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she
could. The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what
it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, "Let us
proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a
crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen." 
Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, 
only make themselves ridiculous. 
The Trees and the Axe 
A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a
handle for his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave
him a young ash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle
to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled
with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest. An old oak,
lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said
to a neighboring cedar, "The first step has lost us all. If we
had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have
retained our own privileges and have stood for ages." 
The Crab and the Fox 
A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green 
meadow as its feeding ground. A Fox came across him, and being
very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being eaten,
the Crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I
on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for
the sea?' 
Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness. 
Page41
The Woman and Her Hen 
A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day. She
often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of
one, and at last, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen
a double allowance of barley. From that day the Hen became fat
and sleek, and never once laid another egg. 
The Ass and the Old Shepherd 
A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was 
alarmed all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy. He appealed to 
the Ass to fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the 
animal lazily replied, "Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely 
the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?' "No," 
rejoined the Shepherd. "Then," said the Ass, "as long as I carry the
panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?' 
In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the 
name of their master. 
The Kites and the Swans 
TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege
of song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so
enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in
trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing. 
The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of
present blessings. 
The Wolves and the Sheepdogs 
THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs: "Why should you,
who are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with
us, and live with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one
point only. We live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave
for men, who in return for your services flog you with whips and
put collars on your necks. They make you also guard their sheep,
and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones to you. If
you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the sheep, and we
will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited." The Dogs
listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of
the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.
Page42
The Hares and the Foxes 
THE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the 
Foxes to help them. They replied, "We would willingly have helped
you, if we had not known who you were, and with whom you were
fighting."
Count the cost before you commit yourselves. 
The Bowman and Lion 
A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search 
of game, but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach. The 
Lion alone challenged him to combat. The Bowman immediately 
shot out an arrow and said to the Lion: "I send thee my messenger,
that from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I 
assail thee." The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear, and 
when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good 
courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied: "You 
counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how 
shall I abide the attack of the man himself?' 
Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance. 
The Camel 
WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast
size that he ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and
gentleness of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to
approach him. Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal
altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to
put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him. 
Use serves to overcome dread. 
The Wasp and the Snake 
A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking 
him unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death. The Snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "At least my
enemy and I shall perish together."
Page43
The Dog and the Hare 
A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for
some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would 
take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with 
another dog. The Hare said to him, "I wish you would act sincerely
by me, and show yourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, 
why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on 
me?' 
No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust
him. 
The Bull and the Calf 
A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through
a narrow passage which led to his stall. A young Calf came up,
and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could
manage to pass. "Save yourself the trouble," said the Bull; "I
knew that way long before you were born." 
The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep 
A STAG asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said
that the Wolf would be his surety. The Sheep, fearing some fraud
was intended, excused herself, saying, "The Wolf is accustomed 
to seize what he wants and to run off; and you, too, can quickly
outstrip me in your rapid flight. How then shall I be able to find 
you, when the day of payment comes?' 
Two blacks do not make one white. 
The Peacock and the Crane 
A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that 
passed by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, "I 
am robed, like a king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the
rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on your wings."
"True," replied the Crane; "but I soar to the heights of heaven
and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a
cock, among the birds of the dunghill." 
Fine feathers don't make fine birds. 
Page44
The Fox and the Hedgehog 
A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of
the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time
very much bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry
blood-sucking flies settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by,
saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies
that were tormenting him. "By no means," replied the Fox; "pray
do not molest them." "How is this?' said the Hedgehog; "do you
not want to be rid of them?' "No," returned the Fox, "for these
flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little,
and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others
more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the
blood I have left." 
The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow 
AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having
found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and
a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. 
The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. 
To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the Eagle,
and said, "Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too,
unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the
earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our
families as food for her young." Having thus frightened the Eagle
out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and
said, "Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you go
out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to
pounce upon one of your little pigs." Having instilled these
fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the
hollow of the tree. When night came she went forth with silent
foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning
to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile,
the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches,
and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from
her cave. And thus they both, along with their families,
perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat
and her kittens. 
The Thief and the Innkeeper 
A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope
of stealing something which should enable him to pay his
reckoning. When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the
Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before
his door. The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him. As
the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at
the same time howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper said, "Why do
you howl so fearfully?' "I will tell you," said the Thief, "but
first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to
pieces. I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor
whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a
judgment for my crimes, or for any other cause; but this I do
know, that when I yawn for the third time, I actually turn into a
wolf and attack men." With this speech he commenced a second 
fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf, as he had at first. The
Innkeeper. hearing his tale and believing what he said, became
greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. 
The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop,
saying, "Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear
them to pieces in my fury, when I turn into a wolf." At the same
moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl. The
Innkeeper, frightened lest he should be attacked, left his new
coat in the Thief's hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn
for safety. The Thief made off with the coat and did not return
again to the inn. 
Every tale is not to be believed. 
The Mule 
A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn,
galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself:
"My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own
child in speed and spirit." On the next day, being driven a long
journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate
tone: "I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could
have been only an ass." 
Page45
The Hart and the Vine 
A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the large
leaves of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot the
place of his concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed,
the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the
huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back,
and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it. 
The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: "I am rightly served,
for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me." 
The Serpent and the Eagle 
A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in 
deadly conflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to
strangle the bird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed
the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent,
irritated at the escape of his prey, injected his poison into the
drinking horn of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his
danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck his hand with
his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried
it aloft. 
The Crow and the Pitcher 
A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find
water, flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he
discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he
could not possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think
of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last
he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them
one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the
water within his reach and thus saved his life. 
Necessity is the mother of invention. 
The Two Frogs 
TWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far 
removed from public view; the other lived in a gully containing little
water, and traversed by a country road. The Frog that lived in
the pond warned his friend to change his residence and entreated
him to come and live with him, saying that he would enjoy greater
safety from danger and more abundant food. The other refused,
saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he
had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy wagon
passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its
wheels. 
A willful man will have his way to his own hurt. 
Page46
The Wolf and the Fox 
AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the
wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and
swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him "Lion."
The Wolf, with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size,
thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his
own race, consorted exclusively with the lions. An old sly Fox,
seeing this, said, "May I never make myself so ridiculous as you
do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though you have the
size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are
definitely a wolf." 
The Walnut-Tree 
A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant 
crop of fruit. For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its
branches with stones and sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously
exclaimed, "O wretched me! that those whom I cheer with my fruit
should repay me with these painful requitals!" 
The Gnat and the Lion 
A GNAT came and said to a Lion, "I do not in the least fear you,
nor are you stronger than I am. For in what does your strength
consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth
an a woman in her quarrels. I repeat that I am altogether more
powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us fight and see who
will conquer." The Gnat, having sounded his horn, fastened
himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts
of the face devoid of hair. While trying to crush him, the Lion
tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. 
The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion, and, buzzing about in a
song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became
entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider. 
He greatly lamented his fate, saying, "Woe is me! that I, who can
wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish
myself from this spider, the most inconsiderable of insects!" 
The Monkey and the Dolphin 
A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to 
amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of 
Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and
he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their 
lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and 
supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), 
came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in 
safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in 
sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were
an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was
descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The
Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor
of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey 
answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate 
friend. 
The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey
under the water and drowned him. 
Page47
The Jackdaw and the Doves 
A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided 
with food, painted himself white and joined them in order to share
their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was
silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to
their cote. But when one day he forgot himself and began to
chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth,
pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food among the
Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing
him on account of his color. expelled him from living with them. 
So desiring two ends, he obtained neither. 
The Horse and the Stag 
AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then a
Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse,
desiring to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he
were willing to help him in punishing the Stag. The man replied
that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to
carry him, he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag. 
The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him. From 
that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, he
had enslaved himself to the service of man. 
The Kid and the Wolf 
A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued
by a Wolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and
said: "I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before
I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to
which I may dance." The Wolf complied, and while he was piping
and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up
and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the Kid, he said, "It is just
what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have
turned piper to please you." 
The Prophet 
A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes of
the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and
announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken 
open and that all his goods were being stolen. He sighed heavily 
and hastened away as fast as he could run. A neighbor saw him
running and said, "Oh! you fellow there! you say you can foretell
the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?' 
Page48
The Fox and the Monkey 
A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.
As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of 
monuments. 
"All these monuments which you see," said the Monkey, "are
in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen and 
citizens of great renown." The Fox replied, "You have chosen
a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none
of your ancestors will be able to contradict you." 
A false tale often betrays itself. 
The Thief and the Housedog 
A THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought with
him several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog, so
that he would not alarm his master by barking. As the Thief
threw him the pieces of meat, the Dog said, "If you think to stop
my mouth, you will be greatly mistaken. This sudden kindness at
your hands will only make me more watchful, lest under these
unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends to
accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's injury." 
The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog 
A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold, 
sought shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly,
lighted a fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with
his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with
meat from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals
determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this
purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each
endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly
characterized himself. The Horse chose his earliest years and
gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth
impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own
opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life,
and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to
labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. 
The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man
is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,
tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and
to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his
necessities. 
The Apes and the Two Travelers 
TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who 
told nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came 
to the land of Apes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be
king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that 
he might know what was said of him among men. He ordered at 
the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his
right hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed for him,
as was the custom among men. After these preparations he
signified that the two men should be brought before him, and
greeted them with this salutation: "What sort of a king do I seem
to you to be, O strangers?' The Lying Traveler replied, "You seem
to me a most mighty king." "And what is your estimate of those
you see around me?' "These," he made answer, "are worthy
companions of yourself, fit at least to be ambassadors and
leaders of armies." The Ape and all his court, gratified with the
lie, commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer. 
On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, "If so great a
reward be given for a lie, with what gift may not I be rewarded,
if, according to my custom, I tell the truth?' The Ape quickly
turned to him. "And pray how do I and these my friends around
me seem to you?' "Thou art," he said, "a most excellent Ape, and 
all these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too."
The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him
over to the teeth and claws of his companions.
Page49
The Wolf and the Shepherd 
A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not
attempt to injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on
his guard against him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict
watch over his movements. But when the Wolf, day after day, kept
in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort
to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian
of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when 
occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely 
in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon
the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. When the 
Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: "I 
have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?' 
The Hares and the Lions 
THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should 
be equal. The Lions made this reply: "Your words, O Hares! are
good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have." 
The Lark and Her Young Ones 
A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green
wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and
attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their
feathers, when the owner of the field, looking over his ripe
crop, said, "The time has come when I must ask all my neighbors
to help me with my harvest." One of the young Larks heard his
speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what
place they should move for safety. "There is no occasion to move
yet, my son," she replied; "the man who only sends to his friends
to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest." The owner
of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat
shedding the grain from excess of ripeness. He said, "I will
come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many 
reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest." The Lark on 
hearing these words said to her brood, "It is time now to be off, 
my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer
trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself." 
Self-help is the best help. 
The Fox and the Lion 
WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by
chance for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened
that he nearly died with fear. On meeting him for the second
time, he was still much alarmed, but not to the same extent as at
first. On seeing him the third time, he so increased in boldness
that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with him. 
Acquaintance softens prejudices.
Page50
The Weasel and the Mice 
A WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to
catch mice as he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour
and lay down in a dark corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be
food, leaped upon him, and was instantly caught and squeezed to
death. Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third,
and still others after them. A very old Mouse, who had escaped
many a trap and snare, observed from a safe distance the trick of
his crafty foe and said, "Ah! you that lie there, may you prosper
just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!" 
The Boy Bathing 
A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He
called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding
out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded
the boy for his imprudence. "Oh, sir!" cried the youth, "pray
help me now and scold me afterwards." 
Counsel without help is useless. 
The Ass and the Wolf 
AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize 
him, and immediately pretended to be lame. The Wolf, coming up,
inquired the cause of his lameness. The Ass replied that passing
through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn. He
requested that the Wolf pull it out, lest when he ate him it should 
injure his throat. The Wolf consented and lifted up the foot, and 
was giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn, when the
Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped 
away. The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled, said, "I am rightly 
served, for why did I attempt the art of healing, when my father 
only taught me the trade of a butcher?'

The Seller of Images 
A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered
it for sale. When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to
attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell
of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up iches. 
One of the bystanders said to him, "My good fellow, why do you
sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself
enjoy the good things he has to give?' "Why," he replied, "I am
in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts
very slowly." 
The Fox and the Grapes 
A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes 
hanging from a trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to get at
them, but wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them. 
At last she turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying:
"The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought." 
The Man and His Wife A MAN had a Wife who made herself 
hated by all the members of his household. Wishing to find out if 
she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he 
made some excuse to send her home on a visit to her father. After
a short time she returned, and when he inquired how she had got 
on and how the servants had treated her, she replied, "The 
herdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion." He said, 
"O Wife, if you were disliked by those who go out early in the
morning with their flocks and return late in the evening, what must 
have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the 
whole day!" 
Straws show how the wind blows. 
The Peacock and Juno THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno
that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song, he 
himself no sooner opened his mouth than he became a 
laughingstock to all who heard him. The Goddess, to console him,
said, "But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the 
emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with 
painted plumage." "But for what purpose have I," said the bird, 
"this dumb beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?' "The lot of
each," replied Juno, "has been assigned by the will of the Fates--to
thee, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the 
raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable auguries. These are 
all contented with the endowments allotted to them."
Page52
The Hawk and the Nightingale 
A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing 
according to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of 
food, swooped down and seized him. The Nightingale, about to 
lose his life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying that 
he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he 
wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds. The Hawk, 
interrupting him, said: "I should indeed have lost my senses if I 
should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds
which are not yet even within sight." 
The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox 
A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together. 
At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The Cock flying
up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog
found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk. When the morning
dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times. A
Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, 
came and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he 
desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a
voice. 
The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: "Sir, I wish you would
do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, 
and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you 
in."
When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang out and caught
him, and tore him to pieces. 
The Wolf and the Goat 
A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice,
where he had no chance of reaching her. He called to her and
earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some
mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was tanding,
and that the herbage was most tender. She replied, "No, my friend,
it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for yourself, who are
in want of food." 
The Lion and the Bull 
A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to
attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to
ensure his destruction. He approached the Bull and said, "I have
slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and
partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your 
company." The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in
the act of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage,
and make his meal on him. The Bull, on approaching the Lion's
den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever
of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his
departure. The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without
a word of salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause
for offense. "I have reasons enough," said the Bull. "I see no
indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I
do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull."
Page53
The Fishermen 
SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them
to be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that 
they had taken a large catch. When they had dragged the nets to 
the shore they found but few fish: the nets were full of sand and
stones, and the men were beyond measure cast downso much at 
the disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had
formed such very different expectations. One of their company,
an old man, said, "Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for, as it
seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was
only to be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced,
should next have something to make us sad." 
The Lion and the Three Bulls 
THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in
ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to
attack them while they kept together. Having at last by guileful
speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without
fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own
leisure. 
Union is strength. 
The Fowler and the Viper 
A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch
birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take
it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched intently,
having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky. While thus
looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just
before his feet. The Viper, turning about, stung him, and
falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, "Woe is me! that
while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares
into the snares of death." 
The Horse and the Ass 
A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the ighway. 
The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. 
"Hardly," said the Horse, "can I resist kicking you with my
heels." The Ass held his peace, and made only a silent appeal to
the justice of the gods. Not long afterwards the Horse, having
become broken-winded, was sent by his owner to the farm. The
Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: "Where, O
boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself
reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?' 
Page54
The Fox and the Mask 
A FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all
his properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a
human head. He placed his paws on it and said, "What a beautiful
head! Yet it is of no value, as it entirely lacks brains." 
The Geese and the Cranes 
THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, 
when a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. The Cranes,
being light of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, 
being slower of flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured. 
The Blind Man and the Whelp 
A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different 
animals by touching them with his hands. The whelp of a Wolf was
brought him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it 
was. 
He felt it, and being in doubt, said: "I do not quite know whether it 
is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full 
well. It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold." 
Evil tendencies are shown in early life. 
The Dogs and the Fox 
SOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces
with their teeth. A Fox, seeing them, said, "If this lion were alive, 
you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your 
teeth." 
It is easy to kick a man that is down.
Page55
The Cobbler Turned Doctor 
A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made 
desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in 
which he was not known. He sold a drug, pretending that it was an
antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by 
long-winded puffs and advertisements. When the Cobbler 
happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the Governor of 
the town determined to test his skill. For this purpose he called for
a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison with 
the Cobbler's antidote, commanding him to drink it on the promise
of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that
he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by 
the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then called a 
public assembly and addressed the citizens: "Of what folly have 
you been guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a
man, whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their
feet."
The Wolf and the Horse 
A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus
addressed him: "I would advise you to go into that field. It is
full of fine oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you
are a friend whom I would love to hear enjoying good eating." The
Horse replied, "If oats had been the food of wolves, you would
never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly." 
Men of evil reputation, when they perform a good deed, fail to
get credit for it. 
The Brother and the Sister 
A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable 
for his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While
they were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to
look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother's
chair. The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl
grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises of her Brother,
interpreting all he said (and how could she do otherwise?) into
reflection on herself. She ran off to her father. to be avenged
on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy,
made use of that which belonged only to girls. The father
embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection
impartially on each, said, "I wish you both would look into the
mirror every day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty
by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for
your lack of beauty by your virtues." 
The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer 
THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a
Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink. They
promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked. The
Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make
them produce finer grapes. The Wasps said that they would keep
guard and drive off thieves with their stings. But the Farmer
interrupted them, saying: "I have already two oxen, who, without
making any promises, do all these things. It is surely better
for me to give the water to them than to you." 
Page56
The Crow and Mercury 
A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, 
making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when 
rescued from his danger, he forgot his promise. Shortly 
afterwards, again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made
the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon
appeared and said to him, "O thou most base fellow? how can I 
believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?' 
The North Wind and the Sun 
THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the 
most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor 
who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North 
Wind first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the 
keener his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around
him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called
upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone 
out with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays
than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly
overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in
his path. 
Persuasion is better than Force. 
The Two Men Who Were Enemies 
TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the same
vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated
himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent
storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger of sinking, the one
in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship 
would go down first. On his replying that he supposed it would be
the prow, the Man said, "Death would not be grievous to me, if I 
could only see my Enemy die before me." 
The Gamecocks and the Partridge 
A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by 
chance he found a tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and 
brought it home to be reared with his Gamecocks. When the 
Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and 
followed it about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled
and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a
stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together
and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then
said to himself, "I shall no longer distress myself at being
struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even
refrain from quarreling with each other." 
Page57
The Quack Frog 
A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh
and proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician,
skilled in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox
asked him, "How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when
you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?' 
The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox 
A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came
to visit their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking that
he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of not 
paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of 
not coming to visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in and 
heard these last words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a rage 
against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and 
said, "And who of all those who have come to you have benefited 
you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place in every 
direction, and have sought and learnt from the physicians the 
means of healing you?' The Lion commanded him immediately to 
tell him the cure, when he replied, "You must flay a wolf alive and 
wrap his skin yet warm around you." The Wolf was at once taken 
and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, 
"You should have moved your master not to ill, but to good, will." 
The Dog's House 
IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as
possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a
house. However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep
stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a
great size. Now he considered that it would be neither an easy
nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would
accommodate him. 
The Wolf and the Lion 
ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own
shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to 
himself, "Why should I, being of such an immense size and 
extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I 
not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?' While
he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and
killed him. He exclaimed with a too late repentance, "Wretched
me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction." 
Page58
The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat 
THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns 
the conquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight,
always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When
peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both
combatants. Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery,
he was driven forth from the light of day, and henceforth
concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and
at night. 
The Spendthrift and the Swallow 
A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his
patrimony and had but one good cloak left. One day he happened
to see a Swallow, which had appeared before its season, skimming
along a pool and twittering gaily. He supposed that summer had
come, and went and sold his cloak. Not many days later, winter
set in again with renewed frost and cold. When he found the
unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, "Unhappy
bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime
you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my
destruction also." 
The Fox and the Lion 
A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him,
bitterly reviled him. The Lion said to the Fox, "It is not thou
who revilest me; but this mischance which has befallen me." 
The Owl and the Birds AN OWL, in her wisdom, counseled the 
Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout, to pull it all up out
of the ground and not allow it to grow. She said acorns would 
produce mistletoe, from which an irremediable poison, the bird- 
lime, would be extracted and by which they would be captured. 
The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax, which
men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. 
And, lastly, the Owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that
this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers
which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. 
The Birds gave no credence to these warning words, but onsidered
the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But
afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her
knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds. Hence it is
that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things,
while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments
their past folly. 
Page59 
The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner 
A TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by
the enemy. He cried out to his captors, "Pray spare me, and do not
take my life without cause or without inquiry. I have not slain a 
single man of your troop. I have no arms, and carry nothing but 
this one brass trumpet." "That is the very reason for which you 
should be put to death," they said; "for, while you do not fight 
yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others to battle." 
The Ass in the Lion's Skin 
AN ASS, having put on the Lion's skin, roamed about in the forest
and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met
in his wanderings. At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten 
him also, but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his than he 
exclaimed, "I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had 
not heard your bray." 
The Sparrow and the Hare 
A HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and ttered
cries like a child. A Sparrow upbraided her and said, "Where now
is thy remarkable swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?"
While the Sparrow was thus speaking, a hawk suddenly seized him
and killed him. The Hare was comforted in her death, and expiring
said, "Ah! you who so lately, when you supposed yourself safe, 
exulted over my calamity, have now reason to deplore a similar 
misfortune." 
The Flea and the Ox 
A FLEA thus questioned an Ox: "What ails you, that being so huge
and strong, you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and
slave for them day by day, while I, being so small a creature,
mercilessly feed on their flesh and drink their blood without
stint?' The Ox replied: "I do not wish to be ungrateful, for I am
loved and well cared for by men, and they often pat my head and
shoulders." "Woe's me!" said the flea; "this very patting which
you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with it my inevitable
destruction." 
Page60
The Goods and the Ills 
ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that ommon
share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by 
reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth. 
The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous
vengeance on their persecutors. They entreated Jupiter that they
might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing
in common and could not live together, but were engaged in
unceasing warfare; and that an indissoluble law might be laid
down for their future protection. Jupiter granted their request
and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in
company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one
enter the habitations of men. Hence it arises that Ills abound,
for they come not one by one, but in troops, and by no means
singly: while the Goods proceed from Jupiter, and are given, not
alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those
who are able to discern them. 
The Dove and the Crow 
A DOVE shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of
young ones which she had hatched. A Crow hearing her, said: "My
good friend, cease from this unseasonable boasting. The larger
the number of your family, the greater your cause of sorrow, in
seeing them shut up in this prison-house." 
Mercury and the Workmen 
A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of a river, let his axe 
drop - by accident into a deep pool. Being thus deprived of the 
means of his livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his 
hard fate. Mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears. 
After he told him his misfortune, Mercury plunged into the stream,
and, bringing up a golden axe, inquired if that were the one he had 
lost. On his saying that it was not his, Mercury disappeared 
beneath the water a second time, returned with a silver axe in his 
hand, and again asked the Workman if it were his. When the 
Workman said it was not, he dived into the pool for the third time 
and brought up the axe that had been lost. 
The Workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery. 
Mercury, pleased with his honesty, gave him the golden and silver
axes in addition to his own. The Workman, on his return to his
house, related to his companions all that had happened. One of
them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for
himself. He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into
the pool at the same place, and sat down on the bank to weep. 
Mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would; and having
learned the cause of his grief, plunged into the stream and
brought up a golden axe, inquiring if he had lost it. The
Workman seized it greedily, and declared that truly it was the
very same axe that he had lost. Mercury, displeased at his
knavery, not only took away the golden axe, but refused to
recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool. 
The Eagle and the Jackdaw 
AN EAGLE, flying down from his perch on a lofty rock, seized 
upon a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons. A Jackdaw, who
witnessed the capture of the lamb, was stirred with envy and
determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle. He
flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a
large ram, with the intention of carrying him off, but his claws
became entangled in the ram's fleece and he was not able to
release himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as much
as he could. The shepherd, seeing what had happened, ran up and
caught him. He at once clipped the Jackdaw's wings, and taking
him home at night, gave him to his children. On their saying,
"Father, what kind of bird is it?' he replied, "To my certain
knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle."
Page61
The Fox and the Crane 
A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his
entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out
into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the
Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat 
afforded the Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked 
the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon with a long 
narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its
contents at his leisure. The Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a
fitting requital, after the fashion of her own hospitality. 
Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus 
ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by
Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by Minerva. 
On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had
made the most perfect work. They agreed to appoint Momus as 
judge, and to abide by his decision. Momus, however, being very 
envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with all. He first 
blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made the horns of
the bull below his eyes, so he might better see where to strike. He
then condemned the work of Jupiter, because he had not placed 
the heart of man on the outside, that everyone might read the 
thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the 
intended mischief. And, lastly, he inveighed against Minerva 
because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her
house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor 
proved unpleasant. Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate faultfinding,
drove him from his office of judge, and expelled him from the 
mansions of Olympus. 
The Eagle and the Fox 
AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided 
to live near each other. The Eagle built her nest in the branches
of a tall tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there
produced her young. Not long after they had agreed upon this
plan, the Eagle, being in want of provision for her young ones,
swooped down while the Fox was out, seized upon one of the little
cubs, and feasted herself and her brood. The Fox on her return,
discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death
of her young than for her inability to avenge them. A just
retribution, however, quickly fell upon the Eagle. While
hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing
a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it,
along with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon
fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged
and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at
the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the Eagle, the
Fox gobbled them up. 
The Man and the Satyr 
A MAN and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of
alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as
they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on
them. When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that
he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold. Later on
in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite
scalding. The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his
mouth and blew in it. When the Satyr again inquired the reason,
he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot. "I
can no longer consider you as a friend," said the Satyr, "a
fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold."
Page62
The Ass and His Purchaser 
A MAN wished to purchase an Ass, and agreed with its owner that
he should try out the animal before he bought him. He took the
Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon
which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the one
that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all. 
Seeing this, the man put a halter on him and led him back to his
owner. On being asked how, in so short a time, he could have
made a trial of him, he answered, "I do not need a trial; I know
that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his
companion." 
A man is known by the company he keeps. 
The Two Bags 
EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the 
world with two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full
of his neighbors' faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own
faults. Hence it is that men are quick to see the faults of others, and
yet are often blind to their own failings. 
The Stag at the Pool 
A STAG overpowered by heat came to a spring to drink. Seeing
his own shadow reflected in the water, he greatly admired the size
and variety of his horns, but felt angry with himself for having
such slender and weak feet. While he was thus contemplating
himself, a Lion appeared at the pool and crouched to spring upon
him. The Stag immediately took to flight, and exerting his
utmost speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept
himself easily at a safe distance from the Lion. But entering a
wood he became entangled by his horns, and the Lion quickly 
came up to him and caught him. When too late, he thus reproached
himself: "Woe is me! How I have deceived myself! These feet 
which would have saved me I despised, and I gloried in these 
antlers which have proved my destruction." 
What is most truly valuable is often underrated. 
The Jackdaw and the Fox 
A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, 
which had produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited 
in the hope that the figs would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so 
long and learning the reason of his doing so, said to him, "You are
indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope
strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with
enjoyment."

The Lark Burying Her Father 
THE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before 
the earth itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth,
she could find no place of burial for him. She let him lie
uninterred for five days, and on the sixth day, not knowing what
else to do, she buried him in her own head. Hence she obtained
her crest, which is popularly said to be her father's grave-hillock. 
Youth's first duty is reverence to parents. 
The Gnat and the Bull 
A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. 
Just as he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and
inquired of the Bull if he would like him to go. The Bull replied, "I
did not know you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go
away." 
Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the
eyes of their neighbors. 
The Bitch and Her Whelps 
A BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place
where she might litter. When her request was granted, she besought
permission to rear her puppies in the same spot. The shepherd 
again consented. But at last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard
of her Whelps, who had now grown up and were able to defend 
themselves, asserted her exclusive right to the place and would not
permit the shepherd to approach. 
The Dogs and the Hides 
SOME DOGS famished with hunger saw a number of cowhides 
steeping in a river. Not being able to reach them, they agreed to 
drink up the river, but it happened that they burst themselves with
drinking long before they reached the hides. 
Attempt not impossibilities.
Page64
The Shepherd and the Sheep 
A SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of 
unusual size full of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the 
branches, he climbed up into the tree and shook them down. The
Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and tore the cloak. 
When the Shepherd came down and saw what was done, he said, 
"O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make 
garments for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who
feeds you."
The Grasshopper and the Owl 
AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the 
day, was greatly disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and 
earnestly besought her to stop chirping. The Grasshopper refused 
to desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the Owl 
entreated. 
When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words
were despised, the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem. 
"Since I cannot sleep," she said, "on account of your song which,
believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in 
drinking some nectar which Pallas lately gave me. If you do not 
dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together."
The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of
her voice, eagerly flew up. The Owl came forth from her hollow,
seized her, and put her to death. 
The Monkey and the Camel 
THE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which
the Monkey stood up and danced. Having vastly delighted the
assembly, he sat down amidst universal applause. The Camel,
envious of the praises bestowed on the Monkey and desiring to
divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand up
in his turn and dance for their amusement. He moved about in so
utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of
indignation, set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the
assembly. 
It is absurd to ape our betters. 
The Peasant and the Apple-Tree 
A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit
but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He
resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a
bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows
entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but
to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. 
He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second
and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the
tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the
honeycomb, he threw down his axe, and looking on the tree as
sacred, took great care of it. 
Self-interest alone moves some men.
Page65
The Two Soldiers and the Robber 
TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber. 
The one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended 
himself with his stout right hand. The Robber being slain, the timid
companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back 
his traveling cloak said, "I'll at him, and I'll take care he shall learn 
whom he has attacked." On this, he who had fought with the
Robber made answer, "I only wish that you had helped me just
now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should have
been the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put 
up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue,
till you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who
have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well
that no dependence can be placed on your valor." 
The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods 
THE GODS, according to an ancient legend, made choice of 
certain trees to be under their special protection. Jupiter chose the
oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele the pine, and
Hercules the poplar. Minerva, wondering why they had preferred
trees not yielding fruit, inquired the reason for their choice. 
Jupiter replied, "It is lest we should seem to covet the honor for the
fruit." But said Minerva, "Let anyone say what he will the olive is
more dear to me on account of its fruit." Then said Jupiter, "My 
daughter, you are rightly called wise; for unless what we do is 
useful, the glory of it is vain." 
The Mother and the Wolf 
A FAMISHED WOLF was prowling about in the morning in 
search of food. As he passed the door of a cottage built in the 
forest, he heard a Mother say to her child, "Be quiet, or I will 
throw you out of the window, and the Wolf shall eat you." The 
Wolf sat all day waiting at the door. In the evening he heard the 
same woman fondling her child and saying: "You are quiet now, 
and if the Wolf should come, we will kill him." The Wolf, hearing 
these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger. When he 
reached his den, Mistress Wolf inquired of him why he returned 
wearied and supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: "Why,
forsooth!
use I gave credence to the words of a woman!" 
The Ass and the Horse 
AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his 
feed. 
"Yes," said the Horse; "if any remains out of what I am now
eating I will give it you for the sake of my own superior
dignity, and if you will come when I reach my own stall in the
evening, I will give you a little sack full of barley." The Ass
replied, "Thank you. But I can't think that you, who refuse me a
little matter now. will by and by confer on me a greater benefit." 
Page66
Truth and the Traveler 
A WAYFARING MAN, traveling in the desert, met a woman 
standing alone and terribly dejected. He inquired of her, "Who art 
thou?"
"My name is Truth," she replied. "And for what cause," he asked,
"have you left the city to dwell alone here in the wilderness?"
She made answer, "Because in former times, falsehood was with
few, but is now with all men." 
The Manslayer 
A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of 
the man whom he murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw 
a Lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. 
He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree, and again
being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river, where a
crocodile caught him and ate him. Thus the earth, the air, and
the water alike refused shelter to a murderer. 
The Lion and the Fox 
A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of
becoming his servant. Each undertook his proper duty in
accordance with his own nature and powers. The Fox discovered
and pointed out the prey; the Lion sprang on it and seized it. 
The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion carrying off the Lion's
share, and said that he would no longer find out the prey, but
would capture it on his own account. The next day he attempted
to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to the
huntsmen and hounds. 
The Lion and the Eagle 
AN EAGLE stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an
alliance with him to their mutual advantage. The Lion replied,
"I have no objection, but you must excuse me for requiring you to
find surety for your good faith, for how can I trust anyone as a
friend who is able to fly away from his bargain whenever he
pleases?' 
Try before you trust. 
Page67
The Hen and the Swallow 
A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them
warm, nourished them into life. A Swallow, observing what she
had done, said, "You silly creature! why have you hatched these
vipers which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on
all, beginning with yourself?' 
The Buffoon and the Countryman 
A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to
the people, and gave a public notice that he would handsomely 
reward any person who invented a new amusement for the 
occasion. 
Various public performers contended for the prize. Among them
came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and
said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been
brought out on any stage before. This report being spread about
made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. 
The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any
apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation
caused an intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his
bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably
with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under
his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out. When that
was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and
loaded him with the loudest applause. A Countryman in the crowd,
observing all that has passed, said, "So help me, Hercules, he
shall not beat me at that trick!" and at once proclaimed that he
would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more
natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the
theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very
generally prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the
Countryman than to see the spectacle. Both of the performers
appeared on the stage. The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away
first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and
cheers of the spectators. Next the Countryman commenced, and
pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes
(which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience )
contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to
squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the
Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored for
the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this the
rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the
most positive proof the greatness of their mistake. "Look here,"
he said, "this shows what sort of judges you are." 
The Crow and the Serpent 
A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny
nook, and flying down, greedily seized him. The Serpent, turning
about, bit the Crow with a mortal wound. In the agony of death,
the bird exclaimed: "O unhappy me! who have found in that which
I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction." 
The Hunter and the Horseman 
A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his
shoulders and set out homewards. On his way he met a man on
horseback who begged the hare of him, under the pretense of
purchasing it. However, when the Horseman got the hare, he rode
off as fast as he could. The Hunter ran after him, as if he was
sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman increased more and 
more the distance between them. The Hunter, sorely against his 
will, called out to him and said, "Get along with you! for I will now
make you a present of the hare." 
Page68 
The King's Son and the Painted Lion 
A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a 
dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a 
lion. 
Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a
pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all
kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a
lion. When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus
confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said:
"O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my
father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account
in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to
you?' With these words he stretched out his hands toward a
thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he
might beat the lion. But one of the tree's prickles pierced his
finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young
Prince fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set
in, from which he died not many days later. 
We had better bear our troubles bravely than try to escape them. 
The Cat and Venus 
A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated
Venus to change her into the form of a woman. Venus consented 
to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that
the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride. 
While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to
discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her
habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room. The
Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the
couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it. Venus was much
disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape. 
Nature exceeds nurture. 
The She-Goats and Their Beards 
THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, 
the He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the
females equaled them in dignity. "Allow them," said Jupiter, "to
enjoy an empty honor and to assume the badge of your nobler sex,
so long as they are not your equals in strength or courage." 
It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should
be like us in outside appearances. 
The Camel and the Arab 
AN ARAB CAMEL-DRIVER, after completing the loading of his
Camel, asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down.
The poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason: "Why do 
you ask me? Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?"
The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass 
A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair
to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of
women collected round a well, talking and laughing. "Look
there," cried one of them, "did you ever see such fellows, to be
trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?' The old
man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and
continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came
up to a group of old men in earnest debate. "There," said one of
them, "it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown to
old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his
old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let
the old man rest his weary limbs." Upon this the old man made his
son dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not
proceeded far when they met a company of women and children:
"Why, you lazy old fellow," cried several tongues at once, "how
can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can
hardly keep pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Miller
immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost
reached the town. "Pray, honest friend," said a citizen, "is
that Ass your own?' "Yes," replied the old man. "O, one would
not have thought so," said the other, "by the way you load him. 
Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than
he you." "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we can but
try." So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass
together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on
their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. 
This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at
it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling
that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and,
tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old
man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again,
convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased
nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.
Page69
The Crow and the Sheep 
A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a 
Sheep. The Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and
forward for a long time, and at last said, "If you had treated a dog 
in this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp 
teeth." To this the Crow replied, "I despise the weak and yield to 
the strong. I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter; and
I thus prolong my life to a good old age." 
The Fox and the Bramble 
A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught
hold of a Bramble to save himself. Having pricked and grievously
tom the soles of his feet, he accused the Bramble because, when
he had fled to her for assistance, she had used him worse than
the hedge itself. The Bramble, interrupting him, said, "But you
really must have been out of your senses to fasten yourself on
me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon others." 
The Wolf and the Lion 
A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off 
to his lair. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took
it from him. Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed,
"You have unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!" To
which the Lion jeeringly replied, "It was righteously yours, eh?
The gift of a friend?' 
The Dog and the Oyster 
A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his 
mouth to its widest extent, swallowed it down with the utmost 
relish, supposing it to be an egg. Soon afterwards suffering great 
pain in his stomach, he said, "I deserve all this torment, for my
folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg." 
They who act without sufficient thought, will often fall into
unsuspected danger. 
Page70
The Ant and the Dove 
AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and
being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of
drowning. A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked
a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her. The Ant climbed
onto it and floated in safety to the bank. Shortly afterwards a 
birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs
for the Dove, which sat in the branches. The Ant, perceiving his 
design, stung him in the foot. In pain the birdcatcher threw down 
the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take wing. 
The Partridge and the Fowler 
A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it. The
Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, "Pray,
master, permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to
you in recompense for your mercy to me." The Fowler replied, "I
shall now with less scruple take your life, because you are
willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends and 
relations." 
The Flea and the Man 
A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and
said, "Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me
so much trouble in catching you?' The Flea replied, "O my dear
sir, pray spare my life, and destroy me not, for I cannot
possibly do you much harm." The Man, laughing, replied, "Now
you shall certainly die by mine own hands, for no evil, whether it 
be small or large, ought to be tolerated." 
The Thieves and the Cock 
SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a 
Cock, whom they stole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon
arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded
for his life: "Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men. I wake
them up in the night to their work." "That is the very reason why 
we must the more kill you," they replied; "for when you wake your
neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business." 
The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions. 
Page71
The Dog and the Cook 
A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends
and acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to
invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, "My master gives
a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup
with me tonight." The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed,
and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment, said in 
the joy of his heart, "How glad I am that I came! I do not often get
such a chance as this. I will take care and eat enough to last me 
both today and tomorrow." While he was congratulating himself 
and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook
saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his 
fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the 
window. He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, 
howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, 
who came up to him and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper.
He replied, "Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much wine that I
remember nothing. I do not know how I got out of the house." 
The Travelers and the Plane-Tree 
TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer's sun, 
laid themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of
a Plane-Tree. As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers
said to the other, "What a singularly useless tree is the Plane!
It bears no fruit, and is not of the least service to man." The
Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, "You ungrateful fellows! Do
you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade,
dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?' 
Some men underrate their best blessings. 
The Hares and the Frogs 
THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and 
weary of the perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one
accord determined to put an end to themselves and their troubles 
by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below. As they
scampered off in large numbers to carry out their resolve, the
Frogs lying on the banks of the lake heard the noise of their
feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety. On
seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares
cried out to his companions: "Stay, my friends, do not do as you
intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still
more timid than ourselves." 
The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant 
THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints. "It is
true, O Jupiter!" he said, "that I am gigantic in strength,
handsome in shape, and powerful in attack. I have jaws well
provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord it
over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is,
that being such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing of
a cock." Jupiter replied, "Why do you blame me without a cause? I
have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and
your courage never fails you except in this one instance." On
hearing this the Lion groaned and lamented very much and,
reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. 
As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant 
and came close to hold a conversation with him. After a time he
observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he
inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a
tremor every now and then. Just at that moment a Gnat settled on
the head of the Elephant, and he replied, "Do you see that little
buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed. I should
die presently." The Lion said, "Well, since so huge a beast is
afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself
dead. I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant." 
Page72
The Lamb and the Wolf 
A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain 
Temple. 
The Wolf called out to him and said, "The Priest will slay you in
sacrifice, if he should catch you." On which the Lamb replied,
"It would be better for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to
be eaten by you." 
The Rich Man and the Tanner 
A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the
unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go
away. The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying
that he would leave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as
time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and
feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints. 
The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea 
A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore,
slept after his buffetings with the deep. After a while he awoke, and
looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches. He argued that
it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had
induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed
them. The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him:
"Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for I am by my own
nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds
suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into
fury." 
The Mules and the Robbers 
TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along. One
carried panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with 
grain. 
The Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if
conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the
clear-toned bells fastened to his neck. His companion followed
with quiet and easy step. All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon
them from their hiding-places, and in the scuffle with their
owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure,
which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain. 
The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his
misfortunes. The other replied, "I am indeed glad that I was
thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with
any wound."
Page73 
The Viper and the File 
A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools
the means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly
addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favor of a
meal. The File replied, "You must indeed be a simple-minded
fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed
to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return." 
The Lion and the Shepherd 
A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn. Soon
afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, 
wagging his tail as if to say, "I am a suppliant, and seek your aid."
The Shepherd boldly examined the beast, discovered the thorn, 
and placing his paw upon his lap, pulled it out; thus relieved of his
pain, the Lion returned into the forest. Some time after, the
Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was condemned
"to be cast to the Lions" as the punishment for his imputed
crime. But when the Lion was released from his cage, he
recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead
of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap. The
King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set
free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and
restored to his friends. 
The Camel and Jupiter 
THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied 
him and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors. He 
went to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns. Jupiter, vexed
at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and
strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give
him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears. 
The Panther and the Shepherds 
A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The Shepherds
discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with
stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about 
to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to
prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of
any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they would find him
dead. The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble
strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit, and
hastened to his den with rapid steps. After a few days he came
forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who
had attacked him, raged with angry fury. Then they who had
spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their 
flocks and begged only for their lives. To them the Panther made 
this reply: "I remember alike those who sought my life with stones,
and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears. I return 
as an enemy only to those who injured me."
Page74
The Ass and the Charger 
AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and
carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to
eat and not even that without hard work. But when war broke out,
a heavily armed soldier mounted the Horse, and riding him to the
charge, rushed into the very midst of the enemy. The Horse was
wounded and fell dead on the battlefield. Then the Ass, seeing
all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse. 
The Eagle and His Captor 
AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately 
clipped his wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other
birds, at which treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief. 
Later, another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to
grow again. The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, 
brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor. A Fox, seeing
this, exclaimed, "Do not cultivate the favor of this man, but of your
former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a
second time of your wings." 
The Bald Man and the Fly 
A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to 
destroy it, gave himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said 
mockingly, "You who have wished to revenge, even with death, the
Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add 
insult to injury?' The Bald Man replied, "I can easily make peace 
with myself, because I know there was no intention to hurt. But 
you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking
human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had
incurred a heavier penalty." 
The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree 
THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was
green all the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with
the seasons. A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the
Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches and broke
them down with its weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty
and killing the tree. But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the
snow fell through to the ground, and did not injure
it at all.

The Eagle and the Kite 
AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of
a tree in company with a Kite. "Why," said the Kite, "do I see you
with such a rueful look?' "I seek," she replied, "a mate suitable
for me, and am not able to find one." "Take me," returned the
Kite, "I am much stronger than you are." "Why, are you able to
secure the means of living by your plunder?' "Well, I have often
caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons." The Eagle,
persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate. Shortly
after the nuptials, the Eagle said, "Fly off and bring me back
the ostrich you promised me." The Kite, soaring aloft into the
air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the
length of time it had lain about the fields. "Is this," said the
Eagle, "the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?' The Kite
replied, "That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing
that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must
fail in the performance." 
The Ass and His Driver 
AN ASS, being driven along a high road, suddenly started off and
bolted to the brink of a deep precipice. While he was in the act
of throwing himself over, his owner seized him by the tail,
endeavoring to pull him back. When the Ass persisted in his
effort, the man let him go and said, "Conquer, but conquer to
your cost." 
The Thrush and the Fowler 
A THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it
because its berries were so delicious. A Fowler observed her
staying so long in one spot, and having well bird-limed his reeds, 
caught her. The Thrush, being at the point of death, exclaimed, "O
foolish creature that I am! For the sake of a little pleasant food I 
have deprived myself of my life." 
The Rose and the Amaranth 
AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus 
addressed it: "What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike 
with Gods and with men. I envy you your beauty and your 
perfume." The Rose replied, "I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but
for a brief season! If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I 
must perish by an early doom. But thou art immortal and dost 
never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth." 
The Frogs' Complaint Against the Sun 
ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to 
take a wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. 
Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the
cause of their complaint. One of them said, "The Sun, now while
he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die
miserably in our arid homes. What will be our future condition
if he should beget other suns?'
